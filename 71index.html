<!-- So, The Anchor tag is used in the navigation bar to make the link of our Navigation bar. 
 
We made our header a flex so that our myntra logo, action bar, anchor tag all comes in our same rows.

We will add the box sizing as the border box at the universal selector at all pages so that if we add the padding, margin and many other things it will not change our measurements and it will add them in the actual size that we have defined.

And we will also add the font family on the universal selector so that all the fonts will be same.

So, Firstly I made a container to store my myntra logo name logo_container.

Then, I inserted an image to it and left the margin by the formula its width / total width * 100.

Then to space evenly between the navigation bar we will justify-content our flex and and to made them in the center of our flexbox we will align-items and provides the value of the center to it.

Then in our navigar=tion bar we will made 6 anchor tags and name them following sections such as Men Women Studio etc.

Then we will made our nav-bar as the flex but the flex will be short so we will be defining the min-width of our flex it means kuch bhi ho but our nav flex will always be equal to the 510px of the width.

Then with the help of the groupng we will group all the anchor tags and will apply the font size and font spacing as same as the given in our website.

Now we will move on to our search bar then we will first add the icon of our search bar to our container of the search bar with the help of the google fonts first we will add the stylesheet onto the header below the css linking part and then we will add the code of the inserting the icon.

Then for our search bar we will define our input and then in our input box we wil define our placeholder and in the placeholder we will write the Search for the products and more.

We will also define the class to our input bar so that we can increase its size and change our background colour.

Now, we will define the height to our search bar of the 40px and the min width of the 400px

Then we will display our whole search bar into the flex and we will apply the flex grow property to our search bar so taht it can fill the whole width of our flex and increases its size.

Now we will align-items into the center so that the both of the elements search bar and the search icon come into the center of the flex  

Now we will define the height of our search bar to the 40px.

Now we will define the height of our icon that is 20 px and we will define the padding to be 10px and for this we wil be doing the box-sizing as the content-box in which the size of our icon will remain the same and the padding will take the extra space for it and we will add the background color to it and also the borde-radius to it.

Now we will define the container named action bar and in which we will also define the three containers inside it namely action container and then with the help of the span element which is used to make the elements inline and use the required space as that of the size of the icons or the text need. 

Now we will made the whole action bar as the display flex.

Now we will made the all three action container as the flex and will apply the property of the flex and due to the class we will able to change all the containers into the flex by applying the flex direction as the columns.

Now we will atleast keep the width of the action bar as the 200px by seeing it in the Myntra website and now we will justify content to it.-->
